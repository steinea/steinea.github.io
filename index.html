<h1>Eric Stein</h1>
<p>Eric Stein (he/him) is a Game Development Instructor at Trinity Western University. A graduate of the English Honours BA program at Simon Fraser University and the Interdisciplinary Humanities MA program at Trinity Western University, his research bridges literature and gaming, applying phenomenological, hermeneutic, and deconstructive methods in the interpretation of interactive texts like FromSoftware’s Dark Souls video games and Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us video games. He is also a practicing game designer, primarily working in the independent tabletop roleplaying space. His design work deploys philosophical, political, and theological concepts in gamic form, bringing together theory and play for social, story-driven tabletop role-playing sessions. His first full-length, commercial game product—Lost Scriptures, a tabletop role-playing zine of story, theory, and faith—was successfully funded on Kickstarter in March 2020. He lives with his partner on the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the Stó:lō Nation.</p>
