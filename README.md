# README

This site was built using Jonathan McGlone's guide, ["Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub"](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). It uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and as such is a static site.

Jekyll handles each page with an individual **index.html** file, structured with a template found in **_layouts**. Jekyll also comes ready for blogging, with markdown files in **_posts** treated as blog entries, using the default layout and some [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) templating to handle entry dating. For a full explanation of how this is implemented, see McGlone's guide.
